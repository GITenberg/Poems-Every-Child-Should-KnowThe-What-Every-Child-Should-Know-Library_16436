<p>It sometimes happens that there are people who do not know that authors
are protected by copyright laws. A publisher once cited to me an
instance of a teacher who innocently put forth a little volume of poems
that she loved and admired, without asking permission of any one. Her
annoyance was boundless when she found that she had no right to the
poems.</p>

<p>Special permission has been obtained for each copyrighted poem in this
volume, and the right to publish has been purchased of the author or
publisher, except in those cases where the author or the publisher has,
for reasons of courtesy and friendship, given the permission.</p>

to extend our thanks and acknowledgments to those firms which have so
kindly allowed us to use their material.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Is this another collection of stupid poems that children cannot use?
Will they look hopelessly through this volume for poems that suit them?
Will they say despairingly, "This is too long," and "That is too hard,"
and "I don't like that because it is not interesting"?</p>

<p>Are there three or four pleasing poems and are all the rest put in to
fill up the book? Nay, verily! The poems in this collection are those
that children love. With the exception of seven, they are short enough
for children to commit to memory without wearying themselves or losing
interest in the poem. If one boy learns "The <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: Poem hyphenates these words."><a href="#The_Overland-Mail">Overland Mail</a></ins>," or "<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: This probably refers to the poem by Housman, which is not included in the book.">The
Recruit</ins>," or "<a href="#Wynken_Blynken_and_Nod">Wynken, Blynken, and Nod</a>," or "<a href="#The_Song_in_Camp">The Song in Camp</a>," or "<a href="#Old_Ironsides">Old
Ironsides</a>," or "<a href="#My_Shadow">I Have a Little Shadow</a>," or "<a href="#The_Tournament">The Tournament</a>," or "<a href="#The_Duel">The
Duel</a>," nine boys out of ten will be eager to follow him. I know because
I have tried it a dozen times. Every boy loves "Paul Revere's Ride"
(alas! I have not been able to include it), and is ambitious to learn
it, but only boys having a quick memory will persevere to the end. Shall
the slower boy be deprived of the pleasure of reading the whole poem and
getting its inspiring sentiment and learning as many stanzas as his mind
will take? No, indeed. Half of such a poem is better than none. Let the
slow boy learn and recite as many stanzas as he can and the boy of quick
memory follow him up with the rest. It does not help the slow boy's
memory to keep it down entirely or deprive it of its smaller activity
because he cannot learn the whole. Some people will invariably give the
slow child a very short poem. It is often better to divide a long poem
among the children, letting each child learn a part. The sustained
interest of a long poem is worth while. "<a href="#The_Forsaken_Merman">The Merman</a>," "<a href="#Ivry">The Battle of
Ivry</a>," "<a href="#Horatius_at_the_Bridge">Horatius at the Bridge</a>," "<a href="#Krinken">Krinken</a>," "<a href="#The_Skeleton_in_Armour">The Skeleton in Armour</a>,"
"<a href="#The_Raven">The Raven</a>" and "<a href="#Herveacute_Riel">Herv&eacute; Riel</a>" may all profitably be learned that way.
Nevertheless, the child enjoys most the poem that is just long enough,
and there is much to be said in favour of the selection that is adapted,
in length, to the average mind; for the child hesitates in the presence
of quantity rather than in the presence of subtle thought. I make claim
for this collection that it is made up of poems that the majority of
children will learn of their own free will. There are people who believe
that in the matter of learning poetry there is no "<i>ought</i>," but this is
a false belief. There is a <i>duty</i>, even there; for every American
citizen <i>ought</i> to know the great national songs that keep alive the
spirit of patriotism. Children should build for their future&mdash;and get,
while they are children, what only the fresh imagination of the child
can assimilate.</p>

<p>They should store up an untold wealth of heroic sentiment; they should
acquire the habit of carrying a literary quality in their conversation;
they should carry a heart full of the fresh and delightful associations
and memories, connected with poetry hours to brighten mature years. They
should develop their memories while they have memories to develop.</p>

<p>Will the boy who took every poetry hour for a whole school year to learn
"<a href="#Ivry">Henry of Navarre</a>" ever regret it, or will the children who listened to
it? No. It was fresh every week and they brought fresh interest in
listening. The boy will always love it because he used to love it. There
were boys who scrambled for the right to recite "<a href="#The_Tournament">The Tournament</a>," "<a href="#The_Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade">The
Charge of the Light Brigade</a>," "<a href="#The_Star-Spangled_Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>," and so on. The
boy who was first to reach the front had the privilege. The triumph of
getting the chance to recite added to the zest of it. Will they ever
forget it?</p>

<p>I know Lowell's "<a href="#The_Finding_of_the_Lyre">The Finding of the Lyre.</a>" Attention, Sir Knights! See
who can learn it first as I say it to you. But I find that I have
forgotten a line of it, so you may open your books and teach it to me.
Now, I can recite every word of it. How much of it can you repeat from
memory? One boy can say it all. Nearly every child has learned the most
of it. Now, it will be easy for you to learn it alone. And Memory, the
Goddess Beautiful, will henceforth go with you to recall this happy
hour.</p>

<span class="i0">'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now, <i>Dasher</i>! now, <i>Dancer</i>! now, <i>Prancer</i> and <i>Vixen</i>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On, <i>Comet</i>! on, <i>Cupid</i>! on, <i>Donder</i> and <i>Blitzen</i>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes&mdash;how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And away they all flew like the down on a thistle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br /></span>

<h3><a name="To_a_Mouse" id="To_a_Mouse"></a>To a Mouse,<br /><span class="subtitle">ON TURNING UP HER NEST WITH THE PLOW, NOVEMBER, 1785</span></h3>

<div class="pre_poem"><p>"To a Mouse" and "To a Mountain Daisy," by Robert Burns (1759-96), are
the ineffable touches of tenderness that illumine the sturdy plowman.
The contrast between the strong man and the delicate flower or creature
at his mercy makes tenderness in man a vital point in character.</p></div>

<p>The lines "To a Mouse" seem by report to have been composed while Burns
was actually plowing. One of the poet's first editors wrote: "John
Blane, who had acted as gaudsman to Burns, and who lived sixty years
afterward, had a distinct recollection of the turning up of the mouse.
Like a thoughtless youth as he was, he ran after the creature to kill
it, but was checked and recalled by his master, who he observed became
thereafter thoughtful and abstracted. Burns, who treated his servants
with the familiarity of fellow-labourers, soon afterward read the poem
to Blane."</p>

<div class="pre_poem"><p>There are several of Sidney Lanier's (1842-81) poems that children love
to learn. "Tampa Robins," "The Tournament" (Joust 1.), "Barnacles,"
"The Song of the Chattahoochee," and "The First Steamboat Up the
Alabama" are among them. At our "poetry contests" the children have
plainly demonstrated that this great poet has reached his hand down to
the youngest. The time will doubtless come when it will be a part of
education to be acquainted with Lanier, as it is now to be acquainted
with Longfellow or Tennyson.</p></div>

<div class="pre_poem"><p>Once a year my pupils teach me "The Finding of the Lyre." By the time I
have learned it they know the meaning of every line and have caught the
spirit of the verse. There is an ancient "lyre," or violin, made in
northern Africa, in the possession of a Boston lady, and I have found
the mud-turtle rattle among the Indians on the Indian reservation at
Syracuse, New York. They use it as a musical instrument in their
Thanksgiving dances. The poem helps to build an interest in history and
mythology while it develops a child's reverence and insight. (1819-91.)</p></div>

Endurance is the watchword of the poem and the watchword of our

mind before he realised it or proved its existence. I have often drawn
a chart of Columbus's life and voyages to show what need he had of the
motto "Sail On!" to accomplish his end. This is one of our greatest

a stately poem worthy of a Goethe or a Shakespeare. England is

the most part, and clad with ivy and roses. Who would not be proud to
have had such a home as Ann Hathaway's humble cottage or one of the
little huts in the Lake District? The homes of America are often more
palatial, especially in small cities, but the use of wood in America
makes them less substantial than the slate-and-brick houses of England.

<div class="pre_poem"><p>Violo Roseboro, one of our good authors, brought to me "A Ballad for a
Boy," saying: "I believe it is one of the poems that every child ought
to know." It is included in this compilation out of respect to her
opinion and also because the boys to whom I have read it said it was
"great," The lesson in it is certainly fine. Men who are true men want
to settle their own disputes by a hand-to-hand fight, but they will
always help each other when a third party or the elements interfere.

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quebec was once a Frenchman's town, but twenty years ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King George the Second sent a man called General Wolfe, you know,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Signed "King of Britain, King of France," and sealed it with a wafer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then proud was Captain Farmer in a frigate of his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grander on his quarter-deck than George upon his throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd two guns in his cabin, and on the spar-deck ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twenty on the gun-deck, and more than ten-score men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as a huntsman scours the brakes with sixteen brace of dogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored the fogs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Cape la Hogue to Ushant, from Rochefort to Belleisle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hunted game till reef and mud were rubbing on her keel.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The lad up in the foretop sees square white sails afar;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Frenchmen's captain had a name I wish I could pronounce;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our captain sat where once he stood, and would not quit his chair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bade his comrades leap for life, and leave him bleeding there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The guns were hushed on either side, the Frenchmen lowered boats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flung us planks and hen-coops, and everything that floats.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Twas by the conflagration the peace was strangely made.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>La Surveillante</i> was like a sieve; the victors had no rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had to dodge the east wind to reach the port of Brest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the waves leapt lower and the riddled ship went slower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In triumph, yet in funeral guise, came fisher-boats to tow her.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for Farmer dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the wounded captives passed each Breton bowed the head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then spoke the French Lieutenant, "Twas fire that won, not we.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You never struck your flag to us; you'll go to England free."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Twas the sixth day of October, seventeen hundred seventy-nine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A year when nations ventured against us to combine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quebec</i> was burned and Farmer slain, by us remembered not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thanks be to the French book wherein they're not forgot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now you, if you've to fight the French, my youngster, bear in mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those seamen of King Louis so chivalrous and kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to Brest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a guest.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sir Richard cried in his English pride:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they sank his body with honour down into the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they mann'd the <i>Revenge</i> with a swarthier alien crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And away she sail'd with her loss and long'd for her own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke from sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till it smote on their hulls, and their sails, and their masts, and their flags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter'd navy of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the little <i>Revenge</i> herself went down by the island crags,<br /></span>

<p>The delight with which trees hang out their new little tassels every
year is one of the charms of "the pine family." John Burroughs sent us
down a tiny hemlock, that grew in our window-box at school for five
years, and every spring it was a new joy on account of the fine, tender
tassels. Mrs. Hemans had a vivid imagination backed up by an abundant
information.</p></div>

<div class="pre_poem"><p>"The Forsaken Merman," by Matthew Arnold (1822-88), is a poem that I do
not expect children to appreciate fully, even when they care enough for
it to learn it. It is too long for most children to commit to memory,
and I generally assign one stanza to one pupil and another to another
pupil until it is divided up among them. The poem is a masterpiece.
Doubtless the poet meant to show that the forsaken merman had a greater
soul to save than the woman who sought to save her soul by deserting
natural duty. Salvation does not come through the faith that builds
itself at the expense of love.</p></div>

Kirk and the two bridges so famous in Robert Burns's verse are near by.
This is an enchanted land, and the Scotch people for miles around Ayr

<span class="i0">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door:<br /></span>
<span class="i8">This it is, and nothing more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sir," said I, "or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I scarce was sure I heard you." Here I opened wide the door:<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Darkness there, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Merely this, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back into my chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon again I heard a rapping, something louder than before:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">'Tis the wind, and nothing more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In there stepped a stately Raven, of the saintly days of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perched above a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure, no craven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven, wandering from the nightly shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore?"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though its answer, little meaning, little relevancy bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With such a name as "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I scarcely more than muttered&mdash;"Other friends have flown before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then the bird said, "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Startled by the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the dirges of his hope this melancholy burden bore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Of 'Never, nevermore,'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust, and door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancy into fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Meant in croaking "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the cushion's velvet lining, that the lamp-light gloated o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Leave my loneliness unbroken&mdash;quit the bust above my door,<br /></span>

<div class="pre_poem"><p>"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard" (Gray, 1716-71). I once drove

passes the estate of William Penn's descendants to Stoke <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: This is usually spelt 'Poges'.">Pogis</ins>, the
little churchyard where this poem was written. They were trimming a
great yew-tree under which Gray was said to have written this poem. The
scene is one of peace and quiet. The "elegy" was a favourite form of
poem with the ancients, but Gray is said to have reached the climax
among poets in this style of verse. The great line of the poem is:</p>

"The path of glory leads but to the grave."<br />

<div class="pre_poem"><p>"On First Looking Into Chapman's 'Homer,'" by John Keats (1795-1821).
The last four lines of this sonnet form the most tremendous climax in
literature. The picture is as vivid as if done with a brush. Every
great book, every great poem is a new world, an undiscovered country.
Every learned person is a whole territory, a universe of new thought.
Every one who does anything with a heart for it, every specialist every
one, however simple, who is strenuous and genuine, is a "new
discovery." Let us give credit to the smallest planet that is true to
its own orbit.</p></div>

<div class="pre_poem"><p>"The Man With the Hoe" is purely an American product, and every
American ought to be proud of it, for we want no such type allowed to
be developed in this country as the low-browed peasant of France. This
poem is a stroke of genius. The story goes that it so offended a modern
plutocrat that he offered a reward of $10,000 to any one who could
write an equally good poem in rebuttal. "The Man With the Hoe" has won
for Edwin Markham the title of "Poet Laureate of the Labouring

<div class="pre_poem"><p>"The Song of Myself" is one of Walt Whitman's (1819-92) most
characteristic poems. I love the swing and the stride of his great long
lines. I love his rough-shod way of trampling down and kicking out of
the way the conventionalities that spring up like poisonous mushrooms
to make the world a vast labyrinth of petty "proprieties" until
everything is nasty. I love the oxygen he pours on the world. I love
his genius for brotherliness, his picture of the Negro with rolling
eyes and the firelock in the corner. These excerpts are some of his
best lines.</p></div>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
